# First step : setup the environment
Firstly, you need to creat a python virtual environment using this command for exemple:
```
python3 -m venv DQN
```
After you activate your environment, you will notice that your command console will be prefixed with the environment name, which is named (DQN) as per our example.

```
source DQN/bin/activate
```
Then you can install the requirement of the project, using the command bellow:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When you are finished in the DQN environment, to exit type:

```
deactivate
```

# Sample GitLab Project

This sample project shows how a project in GitLab looks for demonstration purposes. It contains issues, merge requests and Markdown files in many branches,
named and filled with lorem ipsum.

You can look around to get an idea how to structure your project and, when done, you can safely delete this project.
